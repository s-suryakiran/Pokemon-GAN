# Pokemon-GAN
I created a DC-GAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) using PyTorch programming language and trained it on a dataset of Pokemon images. This allowed me to generate brand new Pokemon images that had not been seen before.

To break it down, a DC-GAN is a type of neural network that uses deep learning techniques to generate new data. PyTorch is a popular programming language used for machine learning tasks. By training the DC-GAN on a dataset of Pokemon images, the network is able to learn the features of Pokemon and generate new images based on that understanding. The result is a set of previously unseen Pokemon images that the network has created.
